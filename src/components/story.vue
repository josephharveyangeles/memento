          I am Loida, 26 now, graduated (B.S. Interior Design, Cum Laude) on March 2012 from the University of Santo Tomas, and was graced to ranked fourth (4th) place in the October 2012 Interior Designer's Licensure Examinations in the Philippines. It may look like I have the perfect start for my career but my life was abruptly changed when I was diagnosed with a rare sickness after five months of working at my first job.

      <q-timeline-entry title="AVM" subtitle="August 7, 2013" side="right">
        <p class="text">
          I can never forget the day when I passed out while in our office then woke up inside a hospital's I.C.U. Days have passed before I learned of my condition. I got Arteriovenous Malformation in my brain, also known as AVM, a tangle of abnormal and poorly formed blood vessels (arteries and veins), which have a higher rate of bleeding than normal vessels. AVM is a congenital disease that can only be diagnosed incidentally or when an AVM caused a rupture or bleeding in the brain like what happened to me. The location of my AVM is in my brainstem that's why the bleeding also caused me to suffer two (2) Major strokes in August 2013. I have undergone an open-skull surgery to remove the AVM on September 4, 2013. After staying for 50 days in the hospital, I was discharged on September 27, 2013. But on November 9, 2013, I was brought to the hospital again. I was diagnosed with "Tracheal Stenosis," or an abnormal closing of the airway. I have undergone another major surgery or "resection of my trachea."
        </p>
        <p class="text">Things will never be the same again after suffering from AVM, strokes, and surgeries. I realized that I lost so much. To date, I am now unable to walk independently, cannot see normally, talk, and move normally. I have vision problems, I speak slowly, and the control and coordination of my body movements are damaged. I cannot draw anymore and my handwriting is like of a child now.</p>

        <p class="text">
          The result of my cerebral angiogram showed that there are still remaining AVMs on my brain. Then on February 2015, I have undergone Gamma Knife Stereostatic Radiosurgery to remove the remaining AVM. After 2 years, I needed my brain to be checked again if I am already free from AVM. It will be three (3) years this February 2018 after my radiosurgery and I needed to undergo another cerebral angiogram again.

      <q-timeline-entry title="A New Crisis" subtitle="December 22, 2017">
        <p class="text">
          Last December 22, 2017, and early this year 2018, I started to have headaches that go on for days. I had a consultation with my neurologists and they required me to undergo an angiogram to check my brain. However, I lack the amount I needed for the test. My hospitalizations, procedures, and laboratory tests have taken a toll on our family. An estimate of more than 3 million pesos is the total amount of everything. It led us to suffer bankruptcy and poverty. All our properties are lost. Business was bankrupt. My parents are separated, my younger sibling had to stop studying in college, and we take shelter in my grandmother's house in the province now.

          The Four-vessel cerebral angiogram is usually 70,000 - 80,000 Php in hospitals and I do not have the means to have this amount. But I am hoping and praying to have my brain checked this February. Itâ€™s almost five (5) years fighting this sickness and I am praying that I'll be finally cleared of AVM.

          After almost 5 years of ins and outs of the hospital, here I am again, seeking for your help and support for my fundraising. I have written a book, entitled "Memento," my personal journal about my experience with its genre, inspirational and humor, edited it as an electronic book (EBook) and sell it online as my fundraising to help myself. I sell it at Php 200.00/copy but I will give it at 50.00PHP/ copy this February. I must continue the fight to live most especially now that I already have a 1-year old son. My whole story was featured last December 16, 2017, in GMA 7's show, "Magpakailanman," and a short feature in ABS CBN's "Umagang Kay Ganda," last Dec.12, 2017. You can check out my interviews on the internet if you want to.

        <p class="text">
          Last March 13, 2018, I had my four-vessel cerebral angiogram. The result showed that I AM NOT YET AVM-FREE. After my almost 5 years of battling AVM, my fight to at least improve our lives aren't over. I still need to be checked next year, to have bronchoscopy every year to check my trachea and to remove the cyst found in my right breast.
